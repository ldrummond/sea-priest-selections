        <h2>Japanese Wine</h2>
        <h3>Pouring in California</h3>
        <p><img class="icon--waves" width="60" src="/icon--waves.svg">Sea Priest Selections is a wine import company focused on forging the connection between the people, the stories, and vibrancy of Japanese wine across the Pacific to California. With an equal emphasis on the excitement of new styles and the example of ancestral traditions, we aim to represent a diverse showcase of the craftsmanship and care of the winemakers of Japan. We are drawn to wines of place, that avoid artifice to communicate transparent snapshots of ecosystem and terroir. We believe that our partner winemakers can offer examples of the beauty of that transparency and that we can foster a lasting relationship between two communities on the cutting edge of the global wine scene.

        <h3 class="h3--alt">Regenerative Oriented</h3>
        <p>
          We celebrate the birth of new traditions, while respecting old ones, highlighting sustainability, a connection to the land, and transparent winemaking that conveys a sense of place. While avoiding dogma, we hope to lift up producers taking the tougher, more arduous route, eschewing industrial convenience for regenerative methodologies — at least organic or biodynamic practices where possible — for the benefit of the soil and the clarity of the final product.

        <h3 class="h3--alt">Low Intervention</h3>
        <p>
          We understand that many factors go into producing a sustainable winegrowing ecosystem, and we strive to feature the work of those choosing chemical free practices in the vineyard and cellar wherever possible. We believe that this philosophy allows for each bottle of wine to arrive with the consumer with the utmost care, preserving its story of terroir and those who brought it to life. Native yeast and chemical free winemaking are priorities more because they take better care of the local ecosystem and produce a wine of honesty, than out of an adherence to a system or philosophy. Low sulphur regiments can indicate a more rigorous and careful hand in the cellar, and do not indicate wine of quality in and of itself. But we have found that partnering with winemakers who practice those techniques allow for a truthful wine that exists as a snapshot of terroir, better than a manipulated product from heavy intervention.
